When using the code you will have the following opitions.

Converting Vector form to Standard form.
Converting Vector form without a or b vaules to Standard form.
a(x+y)^2 to standard
a(x-y)^2 to standard
a(x+y)^3 to standard
a(x-y)^3 to standard

I'm still working on a(x+y)^4 and a(x-y)^4 to standard as well as factoring standard form to factored form. 

If you find any errors, please let me know.
